## Telnet Active X Control


</div>

### Description

This is a telnet client using an active x control I wrote in VB. It is a complete application but the terminal is really just to show you how to use the control. This has a bug fixed from the previous version and a much better terminal. Please vote for this code!!!!
 
### More Info
 
Please see the documentation for the control included in the zip file.
